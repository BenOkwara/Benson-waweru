            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Born in Nairobi, grew up in one of it's famous suburb places with only two wish ("Invent and Be Great!") I had to brave up through the uncertainities of a complex society with the help of strict rules enacted by my
             parents. My ties with my past though, remains as strong like yesterday. Analytical, leadership, intuitive, compassionate, reverent and meek are part and parcel of my daily life. My lifestyle and the hobbies are a reflection of that. <em>You
             can say i am a godly and a cool guy, but not tasty  the majority.</p></em>
