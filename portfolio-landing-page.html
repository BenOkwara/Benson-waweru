        <p>Born in Nairobi, grew up in one of it's famous suburb places with only two wish ("Invent and Be Great!")
         I had to brave up through the uncertainities of a complex society with the help of strict rules enacted by my
         parents. My ties with my past remains as strong as ever. The reverent, meeknesss, honest, leadership, intuitive,
         analytical being part and parcel of my daily life. My lifestyle and the hobbies are a reflection of that. <em>You
         can say i am a godly and a cool guy, but not a taste to the majority.</p></em>
